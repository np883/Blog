    date: "2025-09-19",                           // Date of publication

/*
================ USAGE =================

1. Featured Posts on Homepage:
   - In blog.js, we slice the first 2â€“3 posts from this array and create HTML cards dynamically.
   - Example: const featuredPosts = posts.slice(0, 3);

2. Blog Homepage (blog/index.html):
   - Loop through the 'posts' array and create a card for each post.
   - Each card displays image (if available), title, date, and preview text.

3. Adding a New Blog Post:
   - Create a new HTML post page (e.g., post4.html).
   - Add a new object to this array:
     posts.push({
       title: "New Post Title",
       date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
       preview: "Short teaser text",
       file: "post4.html",
       image: "https://via.placeholder.com/300x180?text=Post+4"
     });
   - The homepage and blog homepage automatically include it.

4. Optional Enhancements:
   - You can include categories or tags by adding extra properties to the objects.
   - You could sort posts dynamically by date for newest first.

This modular structure allows your blog to scale easily, and new posts appear automatically
on both the homepage (featured) and blog homepage.
